## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - React application with TypeScript
- `backend/` - Python FastAPI application
- `.devcontainer/` - Development container configuration

## Development Setup

### Option 1: Using Dev Containers (Recommended)

This project uses VS Code Dev Containers to provide a consistent development environment. The container includes:

- Python 3.11 with FastAPI dependencies
- Node.js 18.x with React development tools
- TypeScript support
- Pre-configured VS Code extensions and settings

#### Requirements

- Visual Studio Code
- Docker Desktop (or equivalent Docker engine)
- VS Code Remote - Containers extension

#### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project folder in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and initialize

Alternatively, you can run the "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" command from the VS Code Command Palette (F1).

For more detailed information about the development container setup, see the [Dev Container README](.devcontainer/README.md).

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- pip (Python Package Manager)

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

The backend server will start running at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend development server will start running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Application

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The React application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories with the following variables:

### Backend (.env)
```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./tasks.db
```

### Frontend (.env)
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## API Documentation

The backend API documentation is available at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Deployment

Production deployment files are located in the `deployment` directory. See [Deployment README](deployment/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to build and deploy the application using Docker.
